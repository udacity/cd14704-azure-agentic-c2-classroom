    "### Key Concepts Covered:\n",
    "1. **Sequential Agent Chaining**: Agents process outputs in sequence\n",
    "2. **Custom Plugins**: Extend kernel capabilities with external functions\n",
    "3. **Temperature Tuning**: Different creativity levels for different tasks\n",
    "4. **Kernel Integration**: Agents share the same kernel and plugins\n",
    "5. **Progressive Refinement**: Each agent adds specialized expertise\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    " \n",
    "### 1. **Sequential Agent Chaining**\n",
    "Agents form a **processing pipeline** where each adds specialized expertise:\n",
    "- **Strategy** → **Marketing** → **Content** → **Integration**\n",
    "- Each agent builds upon all previous work\n",
    "- Final output is richer than any single agent could produce\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2. **Temperature as a Control Mechanism**\n",
    "Different tasks require different creativity levels:\n",
    " - **0.3** (Strategy): Factual, data-driven analysis\n",
    " - **0.4** (Marketing): Structured professional planning\n",
    " - **0.65** (Content): Creative ideation with brand alignment\n",
    " - **0.7** (Integration): Holistic synthesis and narrative flow\n",
    " \n",
    "### 3. **Custom Plugins Extend Capabilities**\n",
    " The `MarketDataPlugin` demonstrates how to:\n",
    " - Add external data sources to the kernel\n",
    " - Make functions available to all agents\n",
    " - Simulate API calls for testing (replace with real APIs in production)\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 4. **Shared Kernel Architecture**\n",
    " All agents share the same kernel, which means:\n",
    " - They can access the same plugins\n",
    " - Consistent service configuration\n",
    " - Centralized capability management\n"
