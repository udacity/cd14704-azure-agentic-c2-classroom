    "1. **Orchestrator Pattern**: Central agent routes requests to specialists\n",
    "2. **Agent as Plugin**: Worker agents registered as plugins for the orchestrator\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Delegation**: Orchestrator decides which agent handles each request\n",
    "4. **ChatHistoryAgentThread**: Maintains conversation context across interactions\n",
    "5. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a narrow, focused responsibility\n",

    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    " \n",
    "### 1. **Orchestrator Pattern vs Sequential Chaining**\n",
    " \n",
    "| **Sequential Chain** | **Orchestrator Pattern** |\n",
    "|---------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| All agents process every request | Only relevant agent processes each request |\n",
    "| Output flows through all agents | Direct routing to specialist |\n",
    "| A → B → C → D | Orchestrator → {A OR B OR C} |\n",
    "| Good for: Progressive refinement | Good for: Discrete task types |\n",
    " \n",
    "### 2. **Agents as Plugins**\n",
    "This is a powerful pattern:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "orchestrator_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(\n",
    "     ...,\n",
    "     plugins=[specialist1, specialist2, specialist3]\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "The orchestrator can **invoke** these agents as if they were functions!\n",
    " \n",
    "### 3. **Separation of Concerns**\n",
    "Each agent has a single responsibility:\n",
    "- **FlightBookingAgent**: Only flights\n",
    "- **HotelAccommodationAgent**: Only hotels\n",
    "- **LocalAttractionsAgent**: Only attractions\n",
    "- **Orchestrator**: Only routing (never answers directly)\n",
    " \n",
    "This makes the system:\n",
    "-  Easier to test (test each specialist independently)\n",
    "-  Easier to maintain (update one specialist without affecting others)\n",
    "-  Easier to extend (add new specialists without changing orchestrator logic)\n",
    " \n",
    "### 4. **ChatHistoryAgentThread**\n",
    "Maintains conversation context:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "thread = ChatHistoryAgentThread()\n",
    "```\n",
    "This allows for multi-turn conversations where agents can reference previous exchanges.\n",
    " \n",
    "### 5. **When to Use This Pattern**\n",
    " \n",
    " **Use Orchestrator Pattern when:**\n",
    " - Requests fall into discrete categories\n",
    " - Different requests need different specialists\n",
    " - You want to minimize unnecessary processing\n",
    " - Specialists have non-overlapping expertise\n",
    " \n",
    " **Don't use when:**\n",
    " - All requests need the same processing pipeline\n",
    " - Agents need to build on each other's work\n",
    " - Request categorization is ambiguous\n",
    " \n",
    "### 6. **Production Enhancements**\n",
    " \n",
    "**Smart Routing:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    " # Use an LLM to classify the query first\n",
    " classification_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(...)\n",
    " category = classification_agent.classify(query)\n",
    " appropriate_agent = agent_map[category]\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    "**Fallback Handling:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Add a general-purpose agent for edge cases\n",
    "general_agent = ChatCompletionAgent(\n",
    "     name=\"GeneralAgent\",\n",
    "     instructions=\"Handle miscellaneous travel questions...\"\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Multi-Agent Responses:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Some queries might need multiple specialists\n",
    " if query.needs_multiple_agents():\n",
    "     results = await asyncio.gather(\n",
    "         flight_agent.invoke(query),\n",
    "         hotel_agent.invoke(query)\n",
    "     )\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Confidence Scoring:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " # Have orchestrator get confidence from each agent\n",
    " # Route to the agent with highest confidence\n",
    " confidences = [agent.assess_relevance(query) for agent in agents]\n",
    " best_agent = agents[argmax(confidences)]\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 7. **Real-World Use Cases**\n",
    " \n",
    " This pattern works well for:\n",
    " - **Customer Service**: Route to billing, tech support, returns, etc.\n",
    " - **Content Creation**: Route to writer, editor, designer, etc.\n",
    " - **Data Analysis**: Route to cleaning, visualization, statistics, etc.\n",
    " - **IT Helpdesk**: Route to network, hardware, software specialists\n",
    " - **Medical Triage**: Route to appropriate medical specialist\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 8. **Comparison: All Three Patterns**\n",
    " \n",
    " **Pattern 1: Independent Agents** (First notebook)\n",
    " - All agents answer every query\n",
    " - Good for: Showing different perspectives\n",
    " \n",
    " **Pattern 2: Sequential Chain** (Second notebook)  \n",
    " - Agents process in order, building on each other\n",
    " - Good for: Progressive refinement\n",
    " \n",
    " **Pattern 3: Orchestrator** (This notebook)\n",
    " - Central router delegates to specialists\n",
    " - Good for: Discrete task categories\n"
