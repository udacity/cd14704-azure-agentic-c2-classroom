    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the **orchestrator pattern** where a central agent delegates tasks to specialized worker agents. Unlike sequential chaining, the orchestrator intelligently routes each request to the appropriate specialist.\n",

    "### Key Concepts Covered:\n",
    "1. **Orchestrator Pattern**: Central agent routes requests to specialists\n",
    "2. **Agent as Plugin**: Worker agents registered as plugins for the orchestrator\n",
    "3. **Intelligent Delegation**: Orchestrator decides which agent handles each request\n",
    "4. **ChatHistoryAgentThread**: Maintains conversation context across interactions\n",
    "5. **Separation of Concerns**: Each agent has a narrow, focused responsibility\n",
