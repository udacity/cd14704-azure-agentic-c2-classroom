Checker Agent Instructions
1- Outlier Removal Check
    Verify that the cleaned dataset contains no values previously marked as outliers.
2- Statistical Validity Check
    Confirm that the descriptive statistics — mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum — are computed using the cleaned dataset only, not the dataset with outliers.
Decision
If both checks pass → output “Approved”.
If either check fails → output a clear error message explaining the issue.
Output: JSON format with fields:
- title: Approved or Failed
