      "1. **Check Power Supply**:  \n",
      "   - Make sure the power adapter is securely connected to both the laptop and a working outlet.\n",
      "   - If possible, try a different power adapter or outlet.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Battery Reset (if applicable)**:  \n",
      "   - If your laptop has a removable battery, unplug the charger, remove the battery, press and hold the power button for 15 seconds, then reinsert the battery and try turning it on.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Hard Reset**:  \n",
      "   - Unplug the power adapter and remove any external devices (USB drives, peripherals).\n",
      "   - Press and hold the power button for 30 seconds. Then plug the adapter back in and try to power on.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Check for Signs of Power**:  \n",
      "   - Look for any lights (power, charging) or fan noise when pressing the power button.\n",
      "   - If lights blink or you hear beeps, note the pattern and let me know.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Try Safe Boot/Recovery**:  \n",
      "   - If you see the manufacturer’s logo, repeatedly press the appropriate key (often F8, F11, or Esc) to access recovery options.\n",
      "   - If you get to recovery, you may be able to roll back the update.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **External Display**:  \n",
      "   - Connect your laptop to an external monitor to check if the issue is with the display.\n",
      "\n",
      "If none of these steps work, please let me know your laptop’s brand and model for more specific instructions. If you see any error messages or lights, please provide details.\n",

    " ## Key Takeaways\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 1. **Agent Specialization**\n",
    " Each agent has a narrow, well-defined role. This mirrors real-world customer service departments.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 2. **Boundary Enforcement**\n",
    " Agents explicitly decline out-of-scope requests, preventing hallucinations and maintaining reliability.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 3. **Scalability**\n",
    " This pattern scales easily: add new agents (e.g., \"ShippingAgent\") by following the same template.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 4. **Production Considerations**\n",
    " - **Smart Routing**: Use a classifier agent or intent detection to route to the right agent first\n",
    " - **Fallback Agent**: Add a general agent for questions no specialist can handle\n",
    " - **Logging**: Track which agents handle which queries for analytics\n",
    " - **Human Escalation**: Some queries should trigger human agent involvement\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 5. **Alternative Patterns**\n",
    " - **Sequential Processing**: Route through agents in order until one handles it\n",
    " - **Voting System**: Multiple agents respond; best answer is selected\n",
    " - **Hierarchical**: Supervisor agent delegates to specialist agents"
