    " # Marketing Campaign Creator-Critic Orchestration System\n",
    " \n",
    " ## Overview\n",
    " This notebook demonstrates the **creator-critic pattern** with **iterative refinement**. A creator agent generates marketing campaigns, a critic agent reviews them, and the process repeats until the campaign meets quality standards or reaches maximum iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  <div align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"lesson_5.png\" alt=\"Alt text\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    " \n",
    " ### Key Concepts Covered:\n",
    " 1. **Sequential Orchestration**: Agents work in a defined sequence\n",
    " 2. **Iterative Refinement**: Feedback loop between creator and critic\n",
    " 3. **Quality Gates**: Critic approves or requests revisions\n",
    " 4. **InProcessRuntime**: Runtime environment for agent execution\n",
    " 5. **Stateful Loops**: Tracking approval status across iterations\n",
    " 6. **Callback Functions**: Monitoring agent responses in real-time\n",

    " ## Key Takeaways\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 1. **Creator-Critic Pattern**\n",
    " This is a powerful quality assurance pattern:\n",
    " ```\n",
    " Creator → Draft\n",
    " Critic → Review\n",
    " If not approved → Creator revises based on feedback\n",
    " Repeat until approved\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Benefits:**\n",
    "-  Ensures quality output through iterative refinement\n",
    "-  Separates creation from validation (single responsibility)\n",
    "-  Captures institutional knowledge in critic instructions\n",
    "-  Reduces human review burden\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 2. **Sequential Orchestration**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " SequentialOrchestration(\n",
    "     members=[creator_agent, critic_agent],\n",
    "     agent_response_callback=callback_function\n",
    " )\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " Key features:\n",
    " - Agents execute in **strict order**\n",
    " - Each agent sees previous agent's output\n",
    " - Callbacks provide real-time monitoring\n",
    " - Perfect for workflows with dependencies\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 3. **Iterative Refinement Loop**\n",
    " The while loop implements continuous improvement:\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " while not approved and iteration < max_iterations:\n",
    "     result = await orchestration.invoke(task)\n",
    "     if \"APPROVED\" in result:\n",
    "         approved = True\n",
    "     else:\n",
    "         iteration += 1\n",
    "         task = result  # Feedback becomes new task\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " This creates a **feedback loop** where output improves each iteration.\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 4. **State Management**\n",
    " Three critical state variables:\n",
    " - `approved`: Boolean tracking approval status\n",
    " - `iteration`: Counter preventing infinite loops\n",
    " - `current_task`: Carries context between iterations\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 5. **InProcessRuntime**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " runtime = InProcessRuntime()\n",
    " runtime.start()\n",
    " # ... orchestration ...\n",
    " await runtime.stop_when_idle()\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " The runtime:\n",
    " - Manages agent lifecycle\n",
    " - Handles message passing between agents\n",
    " - Provides execution environment\n",
    " - Must be started before and stopped after use\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 6. **Callback Functions**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " def agent_response_callback(message: ChatMessageContent) -> None:\n",
    "     print(f\"Agent: {message.name}\")\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " Callbacks enable:\n",
    " - Real-time monitoring\n",
    " - Logging and auditing\n",
    " - Progress tracking\n",
    " - Debugging\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 7. **When to Use This Pattern**\n",
    " \n",
    "**Use Creator-Critic when:**\n",
    " - Output quality is critical\n",
    " - You have clear quality criteria\n",
    " - Iterative improvement is valuable\n",
    " - You want to encode expert review knowledge\n",
    " - Human review is expensive/slow\n",
    " \n",
    "**Don't use when:**\n",
    " - First draft is usually good enough\n",
    " - Quality criteria are subjective/unclear\n",
    " - Iteration costs outweigh benefits\n",
    " - Real-time response is required\n",
    " \n",
    " ### 8. **Production Enhancements**\n",
    " \n",
    " **Limit Iterations:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " max_iterations = 5  # Prevent infinite loops\n",
    " timeout = 300  # 5 minute timeout\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Track Iteration History:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " iteration_history = []\n",
    " iteration_history.append({\n",
    "     \"iteration\": iteration,\n",
    "     \"draft\": creator_output,\n",
    "     \"feedback\": critic_output,\n",
    "     \"approved\": approved\n",
    " })\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Save Intermediate Results:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " with open(f\"draft_v{iteration}.txt\", \"w\") as f:\n",
    "     f.write(final_report.content)\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Add Human-in-the-Loop:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " if iteration > 3 and not approved:\n",
    "     human_decision = input(\"Continue iterations? (y/n): \")\n",
    "     if human_decision.lower() != 'y':\n",
    "         break\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Implement Scoring:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " critic_agent_with_scoring = ChatCompletionAgent(\n",
    "     instructions=\"\"\"\n",
    "     Rate the campaign on a scale of 1-10 for:\n",
    "     - Engagement (1-10)\n",
    "     - Brand alignment (1-10)\n",
    "     - CTA effectiveness (1-10)\n",
    "     Average score must be ≥8 to approve.\n",
    "     \"\"\"\n",
    " )\n",
    " ```\n",
    " \n",
    " **Early Exit on Quality Threshold:**\n",
    " ```python\n",
    " if average_score >= 8.0:\n",
    "     approved = True\n",
    " elif iteration >= max_iterations:\n",
    "     print(\"Approving with current quality level\")\n",
    "     approved = True\n",
    " ```\n"
