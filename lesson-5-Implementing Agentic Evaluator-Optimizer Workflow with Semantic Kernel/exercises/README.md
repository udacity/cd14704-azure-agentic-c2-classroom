# Purpose of This Directory

This directory should contain any files and instructions necessary for exercises created for this lesson.

## Folder Structure

Each exercise should be contained in its own folder using the naming convention of `concept#-name-of-concept`. See example below:

```
exercises
    |_ concept1-hello-world
    |   |_ starter
    |   |   |_ exercise-files
    |   |_ solution
    |   |   |_ solution_files
    |_ concept2-foo-bar
    |   |_ starter
    |   |   |_ exercise-files
    |   |_ solution
    |   |   |_ solution_files
    |_ README.md
```

Lesson 5:

Design multi-agent interactions where multiple SK agents (or “characters”) communicate or cooperate to solve a problem, exploring patterns like agent teams or role specialization.
Implementing Agentic Evaluator-Optimizer Workflows with Python
Students build a two-agent system (a creator and a critic) that works in a loop. The creator generates a solution, and the critic provides feedback until the solution meets all constraints.
Implement an evaluator-optimizer workflow where an AI agent's output is iteratively critiqued and refined by another agent to meet specific criteria.
